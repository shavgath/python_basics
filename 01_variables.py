# Variables in Python


# Its's like a box
    # Has a name
    # Stores things inside
my_variable = 'Hello there'

# Variable with a string being printed to console
print(my_variable)

# Re-assigning a variable
my_variable = "I'm new content being re-assigned to my_variable"
print(my_variable)


# Where is the variable/box stored?
correct_response = 'CPU Registers'
print('the correct response was', correct_response)
print('the correct response was' + ' ' + correct_response)
